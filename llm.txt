o The used LLM tool: Microsoft Copilot

o How and why LLM helped"
It hepled me converting the code from JS to TS, after that I used it to help me with understanding how the configuration can be done for
typescript project.
o What kind of mistakes LLM did: It was fine, but I have checked other resources on the interent to verify that configurations are correct
and actually LLM was better in this regard comparing to other resoucres on youtube. I have not checked official documentations as I have 
other deliveries and needed some quick assistance.
o What were things that LLM was not able to provide: I have used it for small specific task, and therefore, it was good in it.
