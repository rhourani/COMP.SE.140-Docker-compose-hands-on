I found that container shares with the host the network, it does not share software libraries, 
docker have them with it is own isolated, for network, we can specify customized network  for the container to work in 
an isolated capsule, adding on that the ports, are needed to be shared for correct communication.

In more specific words, the docker container is an isolated capsule for the software and what it needs from software libraries to be run.
And the host, shares the operating system kernel, and the needed hardware resouces for the docker engine to be able work 
(such as CPU, storage, RAM etc.)

Also, containers does not include an operation system by itself, that is why it needs an OS kernel.
